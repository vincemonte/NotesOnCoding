Notes on Git
============

- First, initialize the local repository by navigating to the local directory and 
typing: “git init”

- (Optional), type: “git status” to see the status of the files in the branch 

- We will create a .gitignore file
	o this is a simple text file which will include the names of files to be ignored 
	when commits are made 
	o we can use wildcards 
	o notice the change when the status is run again 

- Staging Area:
	o We can add to the staging area with “git add filename” or -A for everything 
	o We can remove from the staging area with “git reset filename” or don’t include 
	the filename to reset everything 
	o To commit files: “git commit -m “”” 		//-m is to include a message 
	o To use a message from a file, use “git commit -F message.txt”

- “git log” will allow us to see past commits and metadata on them 

- Pushing Changes:
	o first stage the changes locally; “git diff” will show you the local changes made 
	o Commit the files locally 
	o Remember: always pull from the repo 	//this applies when working with others 
	o “git push <repo. name> <branch>”
 	o default is “git push origin master”
- Adding a Remote Repository:
	o “git remote add <repo. name> <url>”
	o “git remote” will check the connected remote repo.’s 

- Using an Existing Remote Repo. With Git:
	o to clone a repo: “git clone <url> <where to clone> //don’t include <> 
	o if we are in a pwd and use . as the last param, it will clone all files to the pwd 
	o “git remote -v” will list information on the repo. 
	o “git branch -a” will list all branches locally and remotely
